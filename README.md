Welcome to the Identify Contrails - Reduce Global Warming project! This repository, hosted by [katiarp](https://github.com/katiarp), contains all the necessary information, code, and resources for our project aimed at identifying contrails from satellite images to help reduce their impact on global warming.

## Project Overview

**Project Description:** In this project, we tackle the important issue of identifying contrails, the visible line-shaped clouds produced by aircraft engine exhaust. Contrails play a significant role in climate change, and our goal is to develop algorithms and models to detect and analyze them in satellite images.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll find all the essential resources in this repository. Here's a brief guide:

1. **Project Goals:** The project objective is to develop a machine learning model that can effectivly identrify contrails in images, contribute to the broader goal of reducing global worming through better cotrails detection..

2. **Dataset:** You can find information about the dataset used in this project and how to obtain it.

3. **Code and Notebooks:** Explore the code and Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to see our data analysis and model development processes.

## Repository Contents

This repository is organized to help you understand and contribute to our project:

- `notebooks/`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that document our data exploration, preprocessing, and model development processes.

- `data/`: If the project involves data files, you can place them in this directory for easy access within the notebooks.

- `src/`: Custom code and scripts related to the project can be found in this directory.

- `results/`: Any project results, visualizations, or reports can be stored here.

- `README.md`: You are currently reading the README file, which provides an overview of the project and repository structure.

## Dependencies

If you wish to run or contribute to the project code, you'll need a Python environment with the required libraries. These dependencies may include:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
- TensorFlow (or any other deep learning framework, if applicable)

You can install these dependencies using `pip` or `conda` as needed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
